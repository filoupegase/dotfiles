# 💻 My .files

Just a personal backup of my MacBook's setup. Certainly not a drop-in solution for anybody's machine except my own, but
maybe a few lines will prove useful to you.

(...in other words, after stealing so many sick bash hacks from people on here who are much smarter than me, I felt
obligated to keep the repo public. And in even more words, use the automated scripts at your own risk!)

## Usage

Designed for macOS, also works on Linux (specifially Debian and Ubuntu):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:filoupegase/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```
